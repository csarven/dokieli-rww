<!--
                                Decentralising the creation, publication, and annotation of hypertext documents
                                provides authors with a¬†technological guarantee
                                for independence of any publication authority.-->
                                <!-- NEED: Why something needed to be done at all          -->
                                While the Web was designed as a¬†decentralised environment,
                                individual authors still lack the ability to conveniently author and publish documents,
                                and to engage in social interactions with documents of others in a truly decentralised fashion.
                                <!-- TASK: What was undertaken to address the need         -->
                                We present <cite><a href="https://dokie.li/">dokieli</a></cite>, a¬†fully decentralised, browser-based authoring and annotation platform
                                with built-in support for social interactions,
                                through which people retain the ownership of and sovereignty over their data.
                                The resulting ‚Äúliving‚Äù documents are interoperable and independent of dokieli
                                since they follow standards and best practices,
                                such as HTML+RDFa for a¬†fine-grained semantic structure,
                                Linked Data Platform for personal data storage,
                                and Linked Data Notifications for updates.
                                <!-- OBJECT: What the present document does or covers      -->
                                This article describes dokieli‚Äôs architecture and implementation,

                                without a¬†single point of control.
                                <!-- CONCLUSION :What the findings mean for the audience   -->
<!--
                                dokieli thus enables¬†fully decentralised, user-owned social machines around Web documents,
                                controlled solely by their participants,
                                thereby offering a¬†powerful alternative
                                to centralised content management, blogging and other social platforms.
-->
                                <!-- PERSPECTIVES: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
                                Such an environment provides the right technological conditions
                                for independent publication of scientific articles, news,
                                and other works that benefit from diverse voices and open interactions.

                                While the Web was originally conceived as a¬†decentralised platform
                                where every organisation and individual can participate,
                                it became increasingly centralised
                                with <a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/">less than 1% of the servers serving more than 99% of the content</a>.
                                The main reason for this is rooted in technology:
                                it is currently much easier and more efficient to author, manage, publish,
                                and search large amounts of similarly structured content using a centralised platform.
                                Blogger, YouTube and Facebook, for example,
                                are centralised authoring, publishing, and search platforms

                                However, independence of centralised platforms is a¬†necessity
                                for ownership of published ideas,
                                and to establish a¬†relation of trust.
                                For example, Facebook has been accused of
                                <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/05/yes_facebook_is_biased_now_it_should_admit_it.html">bias</a>,

                                and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/facebook-vietnam-war-photo-nudity.html">censorship</a>‚Äîbut
                                rather than blaming this on any particular platform,
                                we identify it as an unavoidable result of centralisation.
                                After all,
                                there is a¬†continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand,
                                and a¬†guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other.
                                In a¬†fully decentralised setting, each source is filterless
                                and responsible for its own quality and reputation,
                                while others are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources
                                using any mechanism they desire.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Decentralised authoring, publication, and annotation
                                furthermore have the potential to impact areas
                                in which centralisation currently determines the pace of evolution.
                                Scientific publishing, for instance,
                                is often bound to centralised review and dissemination processes.
                                Instead, rigorous scientific discourse could be realised
                                with an open, decentralised environment for the annotation of manuscripts,
                                which has the potential to engage more people sooner.
                                Trust then no longer stems from a¬†finite process with limited transparency,
                                but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation.
                                Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point.

                                If we want to strengthen the decentralised nature of the Web again,
                                we need to develop technologies to simplify the decentralised authoring, management,
                                exploration, and search of Web content.

                                should be designed. These principles are derived from current literature
                                on decentralisation, and Web development best practices.

They allow multiple participants to annotate and hold discussions around the primary content; users must access their accounts to be notified of updates to conversations, and data from both the main content and related discussion is confined to the service which was used to create it.</span>

                                <span id="hypothesis"><cite><a href="https://hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a></cite> makes it possible for users to leave annotations on different types of documents on the Web using a browser plugin or via a proxy.

Despite allowing the attachment of annotations to resources hosted anywhere, they depend on centralised account creation and storage for the annotations themselves. Hypothesis is open source, with an API that uses Web Annotations data model, and may be self-hosted, but currently it is not possible to federate between different instances.</span>

                                <span id="libreoffice-online">Some authoring and publishing systems already go into a decentralised direction. However, they only realize a relatively small subset of the principles outlined in the last section. <cite><a href="https://github.com/libreoffice/online">LibreOffice Online</a></cite>, for example, allows collaborative editing of office documents (e.g., Writer) from the Web browser.

However, it hardly provides accessibility, rich interlinking and annotations or separations of concerns.</span>

                            <p>The tools which provide good collaborative editing UIs appear to do so at the expense of data ownership and interoperability; those which promote creation and publication of data in open reusable formats are lacking facilities for linking discourse and conversation to concepts published. Decentralised creations also mean that each author can choose their own semantics (e.g. their own vocabulary to annotate RDF), and then such decentralised documents can link to each other and their schemas can also be mapped to each other, whereas in centralised platforms this is (if they support semantics at all) often prescribed, either technically enforced, or encouraged by social convention.</p>

                                    <p>Documents use HTML5 <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/">Polyglot Markup</a></cite> to ensure that when served as (X)HTML respectively, they can be processed as either HTML or XML, which is useful in XML ecosystems and toolchains. 
                                    Semantics is embedded directly into human-visible prose using RDFa. The machine-readable data is thus kept in context, reusing the article's text as literal object values, and avoiding data duplication or data ‚Äòislands‚Äô, which can occur when other RDF serialisations are included within HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The appearance of documents is determined with CSS3. Different stylesheets can be applied to the same HTML structure so that a document can be presented flexibly, in the most appropriate way for a particular circumstance. Stylesheets can be switched from either dokieli's menu or through Web browser with native controls, for example from a two-column layout required by an academic journal to a design in keeping with the author's blog.</p>

                                    <p>When JavaScript is enabled, dokieli provides a rich editing interface which includes visual and structural formatting of text as well as embedding machine-readable semantics, media, dynamic citations, and inclusion of statistical charts from live endpoints. An external personal data store, or even internet connection, are not needed at this stage as modifications to a document made in the browser this way can be persisted to a local filesystem using the dokieli menu <em>export</em> function (or the browser's <em>save as</em>).</p>

Through the use of progressive enhancement, document contents are available in text-only browsers, and further functionality of CSS and JavaScript are layered on according to the user agent's abilities.</p>

                                    <p>dokieli's approach to marking human-visible content in RDFa makes it possible to further decouple itself, the application that produced the data, from the data itself, facilitating potential reuse of the data by other applications. A dokieli document can be parsed into a graph, and users can use any other RDF-aware application with the data that was generated by dokieli. Thereby, dokieli can effectively remove itself as a dependency when it comes to data consumption and reuse.</p>

                                    <p>dokieli is able to authenticate users via WebID-TLS if they provide a WebID. This enables further functionality: the user can use dokieli to access protected resources and write to non-public data storage containers if their WebID is authorised to do so. For authenticated users leaving annotations on other documents dokieli fetches their name and display picture from their online profile if available, to display alongside their comment.</p> 

                                    <p>dokieli uses the following vocabularies as standard: <cite><a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a></cite> to describe the general-purpose relations about the document as well as profiles, the <cite><a href="http://purl.org/spar">SPAR Ontologies</a></cite> for scholarly articles and referencing, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa">Web Annotations</a></cite> for annotations (with motivations e.g., replying, bookmarking, commenting, assessments), <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp">LDP</a></cite> for personal storage management, <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl">WebAccessControl</a></cite>/<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl">ACL</a></cite> for access control, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#inbox">LDN Inbox</a></cite> and <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams">ActivityStreams</a></cite> for social notifications, <cite><a href="https://creativecommons.org/ns">Creative Commons</a></cite> for rights and licensing, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov">PROV Ontology</a></cite> for provenance, and the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube vocabulary</a></cite> to consume multi-dimensional data from SPARQL endpoints. Authors can optionally include other vocabularies to mark up specific concepts through dokieli's UI.</p>

                                    <p id="write-operations">Documents can of course be published on ordinary Web servers, as ordinary Web pages. The next layer of enhancement is for authors who wish to edit documents on a Web server directly rather than locally; they can make use of dokieli's write operations. This uses JavaScript, and moves the burden of processing user input from servers (i.e., offering HTML forms and processing of the form submission) to the client.  In essence, the expectation is that dokieli should be a <q>smart client</q>.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>dokieli implements the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a> (LDP) protocol for creating, updating and deleting documents. As such, personal data stores or servers which implement the server portion of the protocol can be used to store and edit dokieli documents directly. An <code>HTTP PUT</code> request to a URL is used to create a <em>new</em> document, to clone an existing one with <em>save as</em>, to <em>save</em> changes, and so that readers of a document can create their own document in <em>reply</em>. All of these operations are available through the dokieli menu.</p>

                                    <p>Interactions with a document take the form of: a comment or (dis)like about the document as a whole, or an comment or (dis)like of a selection of text, i.e. an annotation. In both cases, the dokieli menu presents an input to the commenter, and then, adding additional semantic markup where necessary, sends the data off for appropriate storage so it can be retrieved and re-displayed on future document loads.</p>

                                    <p>Document authors can point to a storage service (using the Web Annotations <code>annotationService</code> property) which lets readers without their own personal storage comment nonetheless. Readers who have a preferred storage location against which they can authenticate are able to direct dokieli to store their input there instead (or in addition). Conforming to LDP, dokieli allows users to remove their annotations with an <code>HTTP DELETE</code> operation. In this way, dokieli does not impose a centralised mechanism for social interactions, and allows users to effectively 'own' their comments, annotations, and reviews, in their own space..</p>

                                    <!-- <p class="todo">[SC: Use this on master/HTML/Web] dokieli currently does not use <code>HTTP PATCH</code> because servers with <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261">XML Patch</a></cite> capability in the Linked Data ecosystem are not well supported. <code>PATC H</code> can be useful towards statement level updates, thereby simpler <em>diffs</em> between versions</p> -->

                                    <p>When readers interact with a document, the author is notified by means of the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (LDN) protocol. A notification, composed of the data from the interaction or annotation, is sent to the <em>inbox</em> advertised by the document or arbitrary parts, thereof.

                                    <p>dokieli employs two complementary deployment approaches: <em>single-page application</em> and <em>Web browser extension</em>.</p>

                                    <p id="single-page-application">dokieli's presentational and behavioural code layers can be included in Web pages in order to trigger them as active single-page applications. It is a smart client that allows different kinds of articles e.g., academic, blog posts, news, to be authored and annotated from within Web browsers, without necessarily having them deployed from a server, i.e., it can be used offline or on localhost. dokieli internally handles its content and well-formed structural and semantic representation based on user's interactivity. Articles, profiles and their contact information, notifications, annotations with different motivations, for instance, can be read and written ubiquitously to any Web space with standard LDP and access control mechanisms.</p>

                                    <p id="web-browser-extension">The Web browser extension is a thin wrapper around dokieli's core code in order to embed itself in any HTML-based Web page on the Web. It inherits all of the features of a single-page application. While HTML based documents on the Web vary in their quality, dokieli's write operations generate well-formed HTML+RDFa. One of the primary utilities for the extension is to have a consistent interface for annotating (comment, bookmark, like) any text selection on a Web page, as well as sharing parts of pages with ones contacts via notifications, without having a service dependency or being limited by the Web page's UI.</p>

                                    <p id="annotations"><strong>Annotations</strong>: A core feature to facilitate collaboration is the possibility to annotate arbitrary parts of a Web document.
                                    Users can select an entity or a span of text of interest, a context menu is presented to input their annotations along with the choice to select a license for their contribution.
                                    If the user is signed-in with their WebID, and provided they have a personal storage space, dokieli discovers this through their online profile and saves the annotations to that location.
                                    Once the annotation is submitted by the user, dokieli proceeds with three operations: 1) the annotation is requested to be saved at the user's personal storage, and if it is access controlled, the user will be prompted to authenticate themselves against that server, before the annotation is saved and is assigned its own URL, 2) if the article or any identifiable statement or segment has its own inbox, dokieli sends a notification to the inbox indicating that an annotation was made and where its retrievable location is, with accompanying metadata like who created it, date, its license etc., 3) the annotation is fetched from its canonical location, and integrated into the article e.g., in marginalia. If the article has a reference to a public annotation service (a writeable space adhering to <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/">Web Annotation Protocol</a></cite>), the user has the option to send a copy of the annotation there as well. In cases where the user does not want to have the canonical copy of the annotation on their server, or if a user does not have write access to a storage, they can still use this option to engage with the article.

Contacts whose profiles advertise an LDN Inbox will receive a notification of the share. The notification contains Activity Streams 2.0 vocabulary terms, and recipients can use any LDN-compatible application to view the notification, without needing to have ever used dokieli before.

If the linked document advertises a standard LDN Inbox, a notification of the citation is sent as well, thus allowing bi-directional linking.

                            <p>
                                The Web‚Äôs design stands out because of
                                its deliberate absence of centralised control,
                                both for technical reasons of scalability and resilience
                                as well as a¬†societal need for freedom of expression.
                                A¬†challenge in such large-scale decentralised networks
                                is how different but related publications can be semantically interlinked,
                                even if they are authored and published by different parties.
                                Centralising their publications is
                                practiced by the majority of authoring networks today,
                                and demands authors to give up some or all of their control
                                in exchange for technical simplicity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On one hand, dokieli shows
                                it is possible to build a¬†social machine
                                wherein people interact with each other
                                without the need of centralised coordination.
                                Users can choose storage space for their content
                                independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content.
                                Documents are connected statically through links
                                and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications.
                                This is a¬†proof for the viability of a¬†decentralised authoring
                                and annotation environment built with existing Web standards.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the other hand, dokieli‚Äôs use of standards
                                shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end:
                                once the document has been created,
                                it lives on as an independent Web citizen.
                                The social machine consists of people and documents,
                                connected by Web standards,
                                with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst.
                                Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieli‚Äôs functions
                                and implement the principles to varying extents.
                                Since the data is loosely coupled to the application,
                                we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem
                                of many current social platforms today.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A¬†couple of important socio-technical challenges remain.
                                Resources might want to indicate in a¬†granular way
                                which actions they support or encourage,
                                such as liking, bookmarking, or sharing,
                                and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent
                                when any of these events take place.
                                In order to encourage positive behaviour,
                                we might want ways to provide moderation,
                                and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse.
                                Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity,
                                and its relation with trust and verification.
                                While there is likely no final solution to these issues in an open ecosystem,
                                it is worthwhile exploring within dokieli or other tools.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Future work can examine to what extent
                                additional features can be realized
                                on top of existing Web standards,
                                or where more development is still required.
                                For instance, real-time collaborative editing
                                is often realized with centralized communication
                                (even though some peer to peer alternatives exist).
                                Services like top-down annotations or automated entity marking
                                can improve the discoverability of a¬†publication,
                                yet the question of how to offer these
                                without being tied to certain servers needs to be still solved.
                            </p>

                                <!-- CONTEXT: Why the need is so pressing or important     -->
                                Decentralising the creation, publication, and annotation of hypertext documents
                                provides authors with a¬†technological guarantee
                                for independence of any publication authority.
                                <!-- NEED: Why something needed to be done at all          -->
                                While the Web was designed as a¬†decentralised environment,
                                individual authors still lack convenient tools to write and publish documents themselves,
                                and to engage in social interactions with documents of others.
                                <!-- TASK: What was undertaken to address the need         -->
                                We present Dokieli, a¬†decentralised, browser-based editing and annotation platform
                                with built-in support for social interactions,
                                on which people retain the ownership and storage of their data.
                                The resulting ‚Äúliving‚Äù documents are interoperable and independent of Dokieli
                                since they follow standards and best practices,
                                such as HTML+RDFa for a¬†fine-grained semantic structure,
                                Linked Data Platform for personal data storage,
                                and Linked Data Notifications for updates.
                                <!-- OBJECT: What the present document does or covers      -->
                                This article describes Dokieli‚Äôs architecture and implementation,
                                <!-- FINDINGS: What the work done yielded or revealed      -->
                                proving that the current technology
                                allows for advanced document authoring and interaction
                                without a¬†single point of control.
                                <!-- CONCLUSION :What the findings mean for the audience   -->
                                Dokieli thus acts as a¬†fully decentralised, user-owned social machine for Web documents,
                                owned solely by its users,
                                thereby offering a¬†powerful alternative
                                to centralised content management, blogging and other social platforms.
                                <!-- PERSPECTIVES: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
                                Such an environment provides the right technological conditions
                                for independent publication of scientific articles, news,
                                and other works that benefit from diverse voices and open interactions.

                            <p>
                                While the Web was originally conceived as a¬†decentralised platform
                                where every organisation and individual can participate,
                                it became increasingly centralised
                                with <a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/">less than 1% of the servers serving more than 99% of the content</a>.
                                The main reason for this is rooted in technology:
                                it is currently much easier and efficient to author, manage, publish,
                                and search large amounts of similarly structured content using a centralised platform.
                                Blogger, YouTube and Facebook, for example,
                                are centralised authoring, publishing, and search platforms
                                for blog posts, videos or social network content respectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, independence of centralised platforms is a¬†necessity
                                for ownership of published ideas,

                                For example, Facebook has been accused of

                                rather than blaming this on any particular platform,
                                we identify this as an unavoidable cause of centralisation.
                                After all,
                                there is a¬†continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand,
                                and a¬†guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other.
                                In a¬†fully decentralized setting, each source is filterless
                                and responsible for its own quality and reputation,
                                while others are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources
                                using any mechanism they desire.

                            <p>
                                Decentralized authoring, publication, and annotation
                                furthermore have the potential to impact areas
                                in which centralisation currently determines the pace of evolution.
                                Scientific publishing, for instance,
                                is often bound to a¬†centralised review process.
                                Instead, rigorous scientific discourse could be realised
                                with an open, decentralised environment for the annotation of manuscripts,
                                which can engage more people sooner.
                                Trust then no longer stems from a¬†finite process with limited transparency,
                                but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation.
                                Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point.

                                If we want to strengthen the decentralised nature of the Web again,
                                we need to develop technologies to simplify the decentralised authoring, management,

                            <p class="todo">[in/out of scope cleanup] Dokieli intends to improve users' interactions and enable an environment in which they control their own contributions, whether they are the authors of a document, annotators, or consumers of the information. In order for the underlying mechanisms to work in concert, dokieli is only intended to address the read-write aspects of the interactions by production, consumption, or notification of data via decentralised means. Therefore, the creation and maintenance of user profiles are not handled by dokieli, rather the expectation is that, users accomplish them using other applications. Similarly, creation and control of personal storages, as well as authentication and authorisation rules are expected to be handled by their preferred tooling and services. .. in scope: adding domain-specific semantics, verification of content/authors, data integrity</p>

                            CL: Not sure if RDFaCE fits here.  It's just the editing widget, not a fully featured application.  In itself, it is neither central nor decentral.</p>

                            <p class="todo">(Ruben): actually, this might not be <em>that</em> relevant; the semantics are not the core point of this paper; we can point to, but shouldn't do much more.<br />
                            Right, but what may be worth mentioning: decentral editing also means that each author can choose their own semantics (e.g. their own vocabulary to annotate RDF), and then such decentral documents can link to each other and their schemas can also be mapped to each other, whereas in centralised platforms this is (if they support semantics at all) often prescribed, either technically enforced, or encouraged by social convention.</p>

What technologies does it use, and why are these independent of dokieli? <span class="todo">Perhaps some of the text below needs to be paraphrased to better respond to the proposed outline above. IMO, there is nothing particularly special other than the application of some principles and good practices. Perhaps I'm overlooking</span></p>

                            <p>Documents use HTML5 <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/">Polyglot Markup</a></cite> to ensure that when served as (X)HTML respectively, they can be processed as either HTML or XML - useful in XML ecosystems and toolchains. RDFa is predominently used to represent the human-visible content to optimise its contextual use - avoids data duplication and hidden islands as is the case with alternative RDF serializations in HTML. Different stylesheets are available in CSS3 and can be triggered either through the Web browser's controls or dokieli's menu. Its JavaScript provides the means to access interactive features of the document, as well as dynamic read-write operations on remote data.</p>

                            <p>Through the application of progressive enhancement, dokieli articles, annotations, and notifications (by default in HTML+RDFa) can be accessible virtually from any Web server, irrespective of them being: accompanied with CSS or JavaScript; enabled or supported by consuming user-agents in a way that is both humand and machine-readable.</p>

                            <p>dokieli's approach to marking human-visible content in RDFa makes it possible to further decouple itself (i.e., the application that produced the data), from its potential reuse by other applications. Hence, users can use other applications on the data that was generated by dokieli. Thereby, dokieli can effectively remove itself as a dependency when it comes to data consumption and reuse.</p>

                            <p>While dokieli can potentially be read from any server or local filesystem, its write operations to external HTTP resources require JavaScript to be enabled in the user-agent. This moves the burden from servers (i.e., offering HTML forms and processing of the form submission) to the client.</p>

                            <p class="todo">Mention which vocabularies it uses out of the box and why/to what purpose</p>

                            <p class="outline">Part B) How are these documents stored and published? (Probably trivial, but that's exactly why we need to mention it. Also important because we discuss annotations next, and their storage is more complicated.)</p>

                            <p id="write-operations">Currently, dokieli uses the HTTP POST, PUT, and DELETE methods for its write-operations given that their affordances are clear i.e., responses to the request indicate if, where, and how the resources may be accessible (<span class="todo">This is in contrast to SPARQL Update operations, which do not necessarily mean that the operation is reflected on the resolveable URLs... is this too much detail? can be it condensed?</span>). HTTP POST is used to fulfill actions like sending an annotation to a public service, or a notification to remote inboxes. In these cases, the receivers decides on their final retrievable URLs. HTTP PUT is used for document-centric actions like: <em>new</em>, <em>save</em> and <em>save as</em>, <em>reply</em>, as well as for user's to save their own annotations at a storage space in which they are authorized against. HTTP DELETE is used to request the removal of annotations for instance, provided that they are authorized. <span class="todo">dokieli currently does not use HTTP PATCH because it needs something like <cite>XML Patch</cite> supported by a server (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/issues/414">Solid issue</a>) in order to make granular/statement level updates on the article. This is useful towards simpler diffs.</span></p>

                            <p class="todo">Ruben removed the paragraph below, as he proposes to split this into two parts. First, there is this section about annotations (what they are and how they are stored). After that, there is the next subsection about notifications, i.e. how the decentralised system is connected. (The deleted paragraph intertwines both things.)</p>
                            <p><del>Users can make their contributions and have them preserved in different ways: authors which control their own articles, parties that have authority over an article's notification inbox, as well as external annotators e.g., reviewers, commenters. dokieli enables different users to voice themselves without interfering or imposing centralised mechanisms e.g., editorial systems. For example, when a user annotates an article, the annotation is stored at their personal online storage. A notification is sent to the article's inbox to inform the consumers of that inbox about that annotation. A typical consumption is where the annotation is shown as marginalia in the article. If for instance, the owners of the inbox (which may or may not be the authors of the article), find the annotation inappropriate, they can remove the notification itself and thereby removing its exposure through the inbox. Since the annotation is controlled independently by its author at their own Web space they preserve the right to retain it. dokieli uses Linked Data Notifications to help with the discovery of <q>voices</q> while each contributor retaining their own respective rights over the entities they create on the Web.</del></p>

Articles, profiles and their contact information, notifications, annotations with different motivations, for instance, can be read and written ubiquitously to any Web space with available access controls.</p>

                                    <p id="web-browser-extension">The Web browser extension is a thin wrapper around dokieli's core code in order to embed itself in any HTML-based Web page on the Web. It inherits all of the features of a single-page application. While HTML based documents on the Web vary in their quality, dokieli's write operations generate well-formed HTML+RDFa and other RDF serializations where applicable. One of the primary utilities for the extension is to be able to annotate e.g., comment, bookmark, any part of a Web page, as well as social shares e.g., via notifications, consistently across any Web page, without having service dependency, or limitations of the Web page's UI.</p>

                                    <p id="annotations-and-notifications">A core feature to facilitate the collaboration is the possibility to annotate arbitrary parts of a Web document.
                                    Users can select an entity or a span of text of interest for instance, where a context menu is presented to input their annotations along with the choice to select a license e.g., Creative Commons, for their contribution.
                                    If the user is signed-in with their WebID, and provided they have a personal storage space, dokieli discovers this through their online profile and saves the annotations to that location.
                                      Once the annotation is submitted in the user interface, dokieli proceeds with three operations: 1) annotation is requested to be saved at user's personal storage, and if it is access controlled, the user will be prompted to authenticate themselves against that, before the annotation gets to be saved and gets its own URL, 2) if the article or any fragment has its own inbox<span class="todo">CL: Don't expect the readers to be familiar with this inbox concept; better prepend one explanatory sentence.</span>, dokieli sends a notification indicating that an annotation was made, where it can be accessed<span class="todo">CL: Isn't this always the URL that was created in step (1)?</span>, with accompanying metadata like who created it, when, its license etc., 3) the annotation is fetched from the personal storage to ensure <span class="todo">CL: Does ‚Äúreally exist‚Äù refer to the personal store (that an annotation is in there) or to the article (that an annotation should have been loaded into memory to make sure it'll be readily available when the margin is populated)</span>that it really exists before it is integrated back with the article e.g., in marginalia. If the article has a reference to a public annotation service, the user has the option to send a copy of the annotation there as well. In cases where the user does not want to have the canonical copy on the annotation on their server, or if a user does not have a personal storage<span class="todo">CL: Maybe even ‚Äúpersonal storage‚Äù will have to be explained.  Not sure how many readers are familiar with it.</span>, they can still use this option to engage with the article.

                                    <p>A key aspect of creating content on the Web is sharing with friends, colleagues or co-workers.
                                    After authenticating with a WebID, dokieli documents can be shared with respective contacts, which are suggested from the contact list of people linked in some way to the WebID of the document author.
                                    dokieli indicates once sharing messages have been posted to the inbox of the respective contacts.

                                    <p>In addition to sharing as social linking, rich semantic links can also be established between dokieli documents itself.
                                    For that purpose, the <span class="todo">CL: I don't understand the phrase ‚Äútext fragment becomes the link text‚Äù.</span>text fragment becoming the link text can be selected in the document.
                                    Via the context menu, a reference using a specific semantic link type (e.g. ‚Äúagrees with‚Äù, ‚Äúconfirms‚Äù, ‚Äúcites as evidence‚Äù) can be selected.
                                    Link types are suggested from SPAR/CiTO and schema.org/citation ontologies.
                                    dokieli automatically retrieves metadata (e.g. title, authors) from the linked document and adds a proper scientific endnote reference.
                                    Furthermore, the linked document is notified (thus allowing bi-directional linking) about the reference via its notifications inbox<span class="todo">CL: When we link to non-Dokieli documents out there, it is quite likely that they don't have an inbox.  1. What happens in such cases?  2. It might be helpful that for some of these advanced web standard we say how widely they have already been adopted.</span>.

                                    <p>Dokieli documents although providing a static view are dynamic in nature.
                                    One particular highlight in this regard (in addition to the integration of videos) is the embedding of dynamically created diagrams and charts.
                                    For example, linked SPARQL queries and inline diagrams (called sparklines) generated from these can be integrated.
                                    After selecting the link anchor text, the dokieli context menu allows to search in registered SPARQL endpoints for respective queries using the keywords from the link anchor text.
                                    The author can select from a list of suggested queries, after which a link to the SPARQL endpoint is integrated along with the sparkline inline diagram.

							<ul>
								<li>How can harassment and abuse be prevented or handled? How would moderation or civil discourse work?</li>
								<li>How can a resource state that it gives consent to be annotated at fine granularity e.g., liking, bookmarking are permitted, resharing, replying are not? How can the conditions to annotate be indicated e.g., the reply should be notified at inbox A, and have a copy sent also to inbox B? How can another resource's annotation policy/rules be respected e.g., some resource opts-out of annotations, so dokieli should not be in-reply-to?
								<li>How can anonymity, pseudonymity, individual, and global identity be taken into account?
								How can domain expertise or reputation be factored in?</li>
							</ul>

                                <!-- CONTEXT: Why the need is so pressing or important     -->
                                Decentralising the creation, publication, and annotation of hypertext documents
                                provides authors with a¬†technological guarantee
                                for independence of any publication authority.
                                <!-- NEED: Why something needed to be done at all          -->
                                While the Web was designed as a¬†decentralised environment,
                                individual authors still lack convenient tools to write and publish documents themselves,
                                and to engage in social interactions with documents of others.
                                <!-- TASK: What was undertaken to address the need         -->
                                We present Dokieli, a¬†decentralised, browser-based editing and annotation platform
                                with built-in social interactions,
                                on which people retain the ownership and storage of their data.
                                The resulting "living" documents are interoperable and independent of Dokieli
                                since they follow standards and best practices,
                                such as HTML+RDFa for a¬†fine-grained semantic structure,
                                Linked Data Platform for personal data storage,
                                and Linked Data Notifications for updates.
                                <!-- OBJECT: What the present document does or covers      -->
                                This article describes Dokieli‚Äôs architecture and implementation,
                                <!-- FINDINGS: What the work done yielded or revealed      -->
                                proving that the current technology
                                allows for advanced document authoring and interaction
                                without a¬†single point of control.
                                <!-- CONCLUSION :What the findings mean for the audience   -->
                                Dokieli thus acts as a¬†fully decentralised social machine for Web documents,
                                owned solely by its users,
                                thereby offering a¬†feasible and powerful alternative
                                to centralized content management, blogging and other social platforms.
                                <!-- PERSPECTIVES: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
                                Such an environment provides the right technological conditions
                                for independent publication of scientific articles, news,
                                and other works that benefit from diverse voices and open interactions.

                                While the Web was originally conceived as a¬†decentralized platform
                                where every organization and individual can participate,
                                it became increasingly centralized
                                with <a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/">less than 1% of servers serving more than 99% of content</a>.
                                The main reason for this is rooted in technology:
                                it is currently much easier and efficient to author, manage, publish,
                                and search large amounts of similarly structured content using a centralized platform.
                                Wikipedia, YouTube and Facebook, for example,
                                are centralized authoring, publishing, and search platforms
                                for encyclopedic articles, videos or social network content respectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, independence of centralized platforms is a¬†necessity
                                for ownership of published ideas,
                                and to establish a¬†relation of trust.

                                rather than blaming this on any particular platform,
                                we identify this as an unavoidable cause of centralisation.
                                After all,
                                there is a¬†continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand,
                                and a¬†guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other.
                                In a¬†fully decentralized setting, each source is filterless
                                and responsible for its own quality and reputation,
                                while others are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources
                                using any mechanism they desire.

                                Decentralized authoring, publication, and annotation
                                furthermore have the potential to impact areas
                                in which centralization currently determines the pace of evolution.
                                Scientific publishing, for instance,
                                is often bound to a¬†centralized review process.
                                Instead, rigorous scientific discourse could be realized
                                with an open, decentralized environment for the annotation of manuscripts,
                                which can engage more people sooner.
                                Trust then no longer stems from a¬†finite process with limited transparency,
                                but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation.
                                Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point.

                                we need to develop technology, which simplifies the decentralized authoring, management,

Therefore, the creation and maintenance of user profiles are not handled by dokieli, rather the expectaton is that, users accomplish them using other applications. Similarly, creation and control of personal storages, as well as authentication and authorization rules are expected to be handled by their preferred tooling and services. .. in scope: addingdomain-specific semantics, verification of content/authors, data integrity</p>

                            <p>dokieli's HTML is generated in a way that is strictly focused on structure, semantics, accessibility, and reusability of the underlying content. Presentational and behavioural components are left to CSS and JavaScript respectively. This is so that without the absense of the CSS and JavaScript, the information remains to be accessible and readable in full even if the document served from a different location</p>

                            <p>When RDFa, and optionally additional RDF blocks (in Turtle, TriG, or JSON-LD) are accompanied, they set the constraints on what can be deterministically moved around or expressed. The underlying RDFa in the HTML makes it possible to discover and reuse the granular semantic information. Hence, dokieli's RDFa use makes it possible to further decouple itself (i.e., the application that produced the data), from its potential reuse by other applications. In other words, users can use other applications to use the data that's generated by dokieli. Thereby, dokieli effectively removes itself as a dependency.</p>

                            <p class="todo">Ruben removed the paragraph below, as he proposes to split this into two parts.

(The deleted paragraph intertwines both things.)</p>
                            <p><del>Users can make their contributions and have them preserve in different ways: authors which control their own articles, parties that have authority over an article's notification inbox, as well as external annotators e.g., reviewers, commenters. dokieli enables different users to voice themselves without interfering or imposing centralised mechanisms e.g., editorial systems. For example, when a user annotates an article, the annotation is stored at their personal online storage. A notification is sent to the article's inbox to inform the consumers of that inbox about that annotation. A typical consumption is where the annotation is shown as marginalia in the article. If for instance, the owner of the inbox (which may or may not be the authors of the article), find the annotation inappropriate, they can remove the notification itself and thereby removing its exposure through the inbox. Since the annotation is controlled independently by its author at their own Webspace they preserve the right to retain it. dokieli uses the Linked Data Notifications to help with the discovery of <q>voices</q> while each contributor retaining their own respective rights over the entities they create on the Web.</del></p>

                                    <p id="annotations-and-notifications">A core feature to facilitate the collaboration is the possibility to annotate arbitrary parts of a Web document.
                                    Users can select an entity or a span of text of interest for instance, where a context menu is presented to input their annotations along with the choice to select a license e.g., Creative Commons, for their contribution.
                                    If the user is signed-in with their WebID, and provided they have a personal storage space, dokieli discovers this through their online profile and saves the annotations to that location.
                                    Once the annotation is submitted in the user interface, dokieli proceeds with three operations: 1) annotation is requested to be saved at user's personal storage, and if it is access controlled, the user will be prompted to authenticate themselves against that, before the annotation gets to be saved and gets its own URL, 2) if the article or any fragment has its own inbox, dokieli sends a notification indicating that an annotation was made, where it can be accessed, with accompanying metadata like who created it, when, its license etc., 3) the annotation is fetched from the personal storage to ensure that it really exists before it is integrated back with the article e.g., in marginalia. If the article has a reference to a public annotation service, the user has the option to send a copy of the annotation there as well. In cases where the user does not want to have the canonical copy on the annotation on their server, or if a user does not have a personal storage, they can still use this option to engage with the article.

									<p>A key aspect of creating content on the Web is sharing with friends, colleagues or co-workers.
									After authenticating with a WebID, dokieli documents can be shared with respective contacts, which are suggested from the contact list of people linked in some way to the WebID of the document author.
									dokieli indicates once sharing messages have been posted to the inbox of the respective contacts.
									</p>

									<p>In addition to sharing as social linking, rich semantic links can also be established between dokieli documents itself.
									For that purpose, the text fragment becoming the link text can be selected in the document.
									Via the context menue, a reference using a specific semantic link type (e.g. "agrees with", "confirms", "cites as evidence") can be selected.
									Link types are suggested from SPAR/CiTO and schema.org/citation ontologies.
									dokieli automatically retrieves metadata (e.g. title, authors) from the linked document and adds a proper scientific endnote reference.
									Furthermore, the linked document is notified (thus allowing bi-directional linking) about the reference via its notifications inbox.

									<p>Dokieli documents although providing a static view are dynamic in nature.
									One particular highlight in this regard (in addition to the integration of videos) is the embedding of dynamically created diagrams and charts.
									For example, linked SPARQL queries and inline diagrams (called sparklines) generated from these can be integrated.
									After selecting the link anchor text, the dokieli context menue allows to search in registered SPARQL endpoints for respective queries using the keywords from the link anchor text.
									The author can select from a list of suggested queries, after which a link to the SPARQL endpoint is integrated along with the sparkline inline diagram.

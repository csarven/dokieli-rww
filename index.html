                                <!-- CONTEXT: Why the need is so pressing or important     -->
                                Decentralising the creation, publication, and annotation of hypertext documents
                                provides authors with a¬†technological guarantee
                                for independence of any publication authority.
                                <!-- NEED: Why something needed to be done at all          -->
                                While the Web was designed as a¬†decentralised environment,
                                individual authors still lack convenient tools to write and publish documents themselves,
                                and to engage in social interactions with documents of others.
                                <!-- TASK: What was undertaken to address the need         -->
                                We present dokieli, a¬†decentralised, browser-based editing and annotation platform
                                with built-in support for social interactions,
                                through which people retain the ownership and storage of their data.
                                The resulting ‚Äúliving‚Äù documents are interoperable and independent of dokieli
                                since they follow standards and best practices,
                                such as HTML+RDFa for a¬†fine-grained semantic structure,
                                Linked Data Platform for personal data storage,
                                and Linked Data Notifications for updates.
                                <!-- OBJECT: What the present document does or covers      -->
                                This article describes dokieli‚Äôs architecture and implementation,
                                <!-- FINDINGS: What the work done yielded or revealed      -->
                                demonstrating that the current technology
                                allows for advanced document authoring and interaction
                                without a¬†single point of control.
                                <!-- CONCLUSION :What the findings mean for the audience   -->
                                dokieli thus enables¬†fully decentralised, user-owned social machines around Web documents,
                                controlled solely by their participants,
                                thereby offering a¬†powerful alternative
                                to centralised content management, blogging and other social platforms.
                                <!-- PERSPECTIVES: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
                                Such an environment provides the right technological conditions
                                for independent publication of scientific articles, news,
                                and other works that benefit from diverse voices and open interactions.

                                While the Web was originally conceived as a¬†decentralised platform
                                where every organisation and individual can participate,
                                it became increasingly centralised
                                with <a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/">less than 1% of the servers serving more than 99% of the content</a>.
                                The main reason for this is rooted in technology:
                                it is currently much easier and more efficient to author, manage, publish,
                                and search large amounts of similarly structured content using a centralised platform.
                                Blogger, YouTube and Facebook, for example,
                                are centralised authoring, publishing, and search platforms
                                for blog posts, videos or social network content respectively.
                            </p>

                                However, independence of centralised platforms is a¬†necessity
                                for ownership of published ideas,
                                and to establish a¬†relation of trust.
                                For example, Facebook has been accused of
                                <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/05/yes_facebook_is_biased_now_it_should_admit_it.html">bias</a>,
                                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth">false information</a>,
                                and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/facebook-vietnam-war-photo-nudity.html">censorship</a>‚Äîbut
                                rather than blaming this on any particular platform,
                                we identify it as an unavoidable result of centralisation.
                                After all,
                                there is a¬†continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand,
                                and a¬†guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other.
                                In a¬†fully decentralised setting, each source is filterless
                                and responsible for its own quality and reputation,
                                while others are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources
                                using any mechanism they desire.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Decentralized authoring, publication, and annotation
                                furthermore have the potential to impact areas
                                in which centralisation currently determines the pace of evolution.
                                Scientific publishing, for instance,
                                is often bound to centralised review and dissemination processes.
                                Instead, rigorous scientific discourse could be realised
                                with an open, decentralised environment for the annotation of manuscripts,
                                which has the potential to engage more people sooner.
                                Trust then no longer stems from a¬†finite process with limited transparency,
                                but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation.
                                Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point.

                                If we want to strengthen the decentralised nature of the Web again,
                                we need to develop technologies to simplify the decentralised authoring, management,
                                exploration, and search of Web content.

                            <p>In this section, we explain the principles and aspects that an approach for decentralized authoring, annotation and notifications should have, providing a way to test specific approaches to the extend they fulfill the requirements. <span class="fixme">The wording should be such that there is some spectrum to this, and not a binary hit-miss. Otherwise, it is self-fulling i.e., we are just describing dokieli principles, but not a general list of principles that can be picked up. After all, we are pushing the argument that other applications should be built in a way that can work/interoperate with dokieli... and that dokieli is not the only answer here.</span></p>

                            <h3 id="principles">Principles and standards</h3>
                            <p>The following principles and standards are particularly relevant for decentralized authoring.</p>

                            <dl>
                                <dt>Data storage independent of service providers</dt>
                                <dd>Users should have the freedom to choose where they store their data and who is allowed to access it.
								To some extend this feature is called ‚Äúdata sovereignty‚Äù (e.g. by the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299536747_Industrial_Data_Space_Digital_Souvereignity_Over_Data">Industrial Data Space initiative</a>).</p></dd>

                                <dt>Compliance with Web standards and protocols</dt>
                                <dd>The decoupling of the application logic from the data will allow users to avoid vendor lock-ins, and seamlessly switch between applications and personal data storage servers. This is prudent to application's behaviour, as well as endpoints it is able communicate with, e.g., avoiding proprietary APIs. Thereby the design of the application focuses on well-defined Web standards and protocols, e.g., IETF RFC, W3C Recommendations, as opposed to individual software implementations to achieve maximum interoperability.</dd>

                                <dt>Separation of concerns</dt>
                                <dd>The <em>progressive enhancement</em> strategy to connect the structural, presentational, and behavioural layers allows content and base functionality to be accessible to basic Web browsers and other user-agent types; consumed through different media and devices; and unobtrusive interactive features while enhancing the interface, do not hinder core usability and access to data.</dd>

                                <dt>Accessibility</dt>
                                <dd>In order to lower the barrier for entry all forms of participation, enhanced functionality of the application should be accessible to users based on the capabilities of their user-agents, storage availability, network access, or personal and preferences.</dd>

                                <dt>Anyone can say anything about anything</dt>
                                <dd>A distributed authoring appraoch should follow the open-world principle, where any author can say anything about anything. Identifying everything using [de]referenceable IRIs allows any distributed authoring or annotation application to reference and link to priorly published content. To some extend, this requirement (and the absense of predefined authoritative source, centralized identifier mints or publication clearinghouses) also helps to ensure freedom of expression in general.</dd>

                                <dt>Web of Trust</dt>
                                <dd>The Web as a collaborative medium makes it possible for people to take responsibility (or be accountable) for their contributions. It should be possible for people to publish, share, and annotate information while ensuring their provenance, authenticity and integrity.</dd>

In order for the underlying mechanisms to work in concert, dokieli is only intended to address the read-write aspects of the interactions by production, consumption, or notification of data via decentralised means. Therefore, the creation and maintenance of user profiles are not handled by dokieli, rather the expectation is that, users accomplish them using other applications. Similarly, creation and control of personal storages, profile management, as well as authentication and authorisation rules are expected to be handled by their preferred tooling and services. .. in scope: adding domain-specific semantics, verification of content/authors, data integrity</p>

                            CL: Not sure if RDFaCE fits here.  It's just the editing widget, not a fully featured application.  In itself, it is neither central nor decentral.</p>

                            Right, but what may be worth mentioning: decentral editing also means that each author can choose their own semantics (e.g. their own vocabulary to annotate RDF), and then such decentral documents can link to each other and their schemas can also be mapped to each other, whereas in centralised platforms this is (if they support semantics at all) often prescribed, either technically enforced, or encouraged by social convention.</p>

                            <p>Decentralised read-write environments make it possible for different actors (e.g., authors, reviewers) to have their own personal online storages where they can: manage their data; have socially-aware access controls on the data (e.g., who gets to see and update what); send notifications to the attention of people and documents based on their interactions, and; permit different applications to operate on the data, including moving the data from one server to another seamlessly.</p>

It is independent from specific server-side software, proprietary APIs or the requirement to have an account. Users can participate using their own profiles (WebIDs) located anywhere on the Web, and get to store and make their annotations where they prefer, as well as assign access controls to documents. Similarly, a decentralised communications protocol, <cite><a href="http://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> [<a href="#ref-LDN">LDN</a>], is used get past the limits of centralisation by enabling communication to happen across servers.</p>

                            <h3>Creating documents</h3>
                            <p class="outline">Part A) What will the document look like? How is it different compared to existing documents? What technologies does it use, and why are these independent of dokieli? <span class="todo">Perhaps some of the text below needs to be paraphrased to better respond to the proposed outline above. IMO, there is nothing particularly special other than the application of some principles and good practices. Perhaps I'm overlooking</span></p>

                            <p>Documents use HTML5 <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/">Polyglot Markup</a></cite> to ensure that when served as (X)HTML respectively, they can be processed as either HTML or XML, which is useful in XML ecosystems and toolchains. 
                            Semantics is embedded directly into human-visible prose using RDFa. The machine-readable data is thus kept in context, reusing the article's text as literal object values, and avoiding data duplication or data ‚Äòislands‚Äô, which can occur when other RDF serialisations are included within HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements.
                            </p>
                            <p class="todo">CL: Maybe I'd even omit the part from ‚Äúwhich can occur‚Äù because that's just one special case.  Even with RDFa you can have data islands.  Think of &lt;span about="subject" property="predicate" content="object"/&gt;.</p>
                            <p>The appearance of documents is determined with CSS3. Different stylesheets can be applied to the same HTML structure so that a document can be presented flexibly, in the most appropriate way for a particular circumstance. Stylesheets can be switched from either dokieli's menu or through Web browser with native controls, for example from a two-column layout required by an academic journal to a design inkeeping with the author's blog.</p>

                            <p>When JavaScript is enabled, dokieli provides a rich editing interface which includes visual and structural formatting of text as well as embedding machine-readable semantics, media, dynamic citations, and inclusion of statistical charts from live endpoints. An external personal data store, or even internet connection, are not needed at this stage as modifications to a document made in the browser this way can be persisted to a local filesystem using the dokieli menu <em>export</em> function (or the browser's <em>save as</em>).</p> 

                            <h3>Consuming documents</h3>

                            <p>Documents for example in HTML+RDFa while being both human and machine-readable can be retrieved from Web servers with a single HTTP GET request. Through the use of progressive enhancement, document contents are available in text-only browsers, and further functionality of CSS and JavaScript are layered on according to the user agent's abilities.</p>

                            <p>dokieli's approach to marking human-visible content in RDFa makes it possible to further decouple itself, the application that produced the data, from the data itself, facilitating potential reuse of the data by other applications. A dokieli document can be parsed into a graph, and users can use any other RDF-aware application with the data that was generated by dokieli. Thereby, dokieli can effectively remove itself as a dependency when it comes to data consumption and reuse.</p>

                            <p>dokieli uses the following vocabularies within a document: <span class="todo">CL: Is there a reason that some links are surrounded by "cite" tags and thus appear in italic, whereas others are not?  Looks inconsistent in any case.</span><cite><a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a></cite> to describe the general-purpose relations about the document as well as profiles, the <cite><a href="http://purl.org/spar">SPAR Ontologies</a></cite> for scholarly articles and referencing, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa">Web Annotations</a></cite> for annotations (with motivations e.g., replying, bookmarking, commenting, assessments), <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp">LDP</a></cite> for personal storage management, <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl">WebAccessControl</a>/<a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl">ACL</a> for access control, <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#inbox">LDN Inbox</a> and <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams">ActivityStreams</a></cite> social notifications, <cite><a href="https://creativecommons.org/ns">Creative Commons</a></cite> for rights and licensing, <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov">PROV Ontology</a> for provenance, and its awareness of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube vocabulary</a> to consume multi-dimensional data from SPARQL endpoints. Authors can optionally include other vocabularies to mark up specific concepts through dokieli's UI.</p>

                            <h3>Publishing documents</h3>

                            <p class="outline">Part B) How are these documents stored and published? (Probably trivial, but that's exactly why we need to mention it. Also important because we discuss annotations next, and their storage is more complicated.)</p>
                            
                            <p id="write-operations">Documents can of course be published on ordinary Web servers, as ordinary Web pages. The next layer of enhancement is for authors who wish to edit documents on a Web server directly rather than locally; they can make use of dokieli's write operations. This uses JavaScript, and moves the burden of processing user input from servers (i.e., offering HTML forms and processing of the form submission) to the client.  In essence, the expectation is that dokieli should be a <q>smart client</q>.</p>
                            
                            <p>dokieli implements the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a> (LDP) protocol for creating, updating and deleting documents. As such, personal data stores or servers which implement the server portion of the protocol can be used to store and edit dokieli documents directly. An <code>HTTP PUT</code> request to a URL is used to create a <em>new</em> document, to clone an existing one with <em>save as</em>, to <em>save</em> changes, and so that readers of a document can create their own document in <em>reply</em>. All of these operations are available through the dokieli menu.</p>

                            <h3>Social interactions and annotations</h3>
                            <p class="outline">Part A) What do they look like? </p>

                            <p class="outline">Part B) How are they stored and published?</p>

                            <p>Interactions with a document take the form of: a comment or (dis)like about the document as a whole, or an comment or (dis)like of a selection of text, i.e. an annotation. In both cases, the dokieli menu presents an input to the commenter, and then, adding additional semantic markup where necessary, sends the data off for appropriate storage so it can be retrieved and re-displayed on future document loads.</p>

                            <p>Document authors can point to a storage service (using the Web Annotations <code>annotationService</code> property) which lets readers without their own personal storage comment nonetheless. Readers who have a preferred storage location against which they can authenticate are able to direct dokieli to store their input there instead (or in addition). Conforming to LDP, dokieli allows users to remove their annotations with an <code>HTTP DELETE</code> operation. In this way, dokieli does not impose a centralised mechanism for social interactions, and allows users to effectively 'own' their comments, annotations, and reviews, in their own space..</p>

                            <p>When readers interact with a document, the author is notified by means of the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (LDN) protocol. A notification, composed of the data from the interaction or annotation, is sent to the <em>inbox</em> advertised by the document or arbitrary parts, thereof. This inbox may be on the same server as the document itself, or may be elsewhere. dokieli subsequently reads this inbox to display interactions and annotations on the document.</p>

                            <p>As the <em>author</em> of the document has control of the inbox, they can remove notifications for interactions they find inappropriate, <em>without</em> needing to worry about their inability to access the original source of the interaction. Conversely, annotators do not lose control or authority over their contributions, even if the object of their interaction wishes to disassociate itself. Each contributor retains their own respective rights over the entities they create on the Web.</p>

                                    <p>dokieli employs two complementary deployment approaches: <em>single-page application</em> and <em>Web browser extension</em>.</p>

                                    <p id="single-page-application">dokieli's presentational and behavioural code layers can be included in Web pages in order to trigger them as active single-page applications. It is a smart client that allows different kinds of articles e.g., academic, blog posts, news, to be authored and annotated from within Web browsers, without necessarily having them deployed from a server, i.e., it can be used offline or on localhost. dokieli internally handles its content and structural representation through its own UI, where the underlying data is dynamically exchanged between servers. Articles, profiles and their contact information, notifications, annotations with different motivations, for instance, can be read and written ubiquitously to any Web space with available access controls.</p>

                                    <p id="web-browser-extension">The Web browser extension is a thin wrapper around dokieli's core code in order to embed itself in any HTML-based Web page on the Web. It inherits all of the features of a single-page application. While HTML based documents on the Web vary in their quality, dokieli's write operations generate well-formed HTML+RDFa and other RDF serialisations where applicable. One of the primary utilities for the extension is to be able to annotate e.g., comment, bookmark, any part of a Web page, as well as social shares e.g., via notifications, consistently across any Web page, without having a service dependency or being limited by the Web page's UI.</p>

                                    <p id="annotations-and-notifications">A core feature to facilitate collaboration is the possibility to annotate arbitrary parts of a Web document.
                                    Users can select an entity or a span of text of interest, where a context menu is presented to input their annotations along with the choice to select a license e.g., Creative Commons, for their contribution.
                                    If the user is signed-in with their WebID, and provided they have a personal storage space, dokieli discovers this through their online profile and saves the annotations to that location.
                                      Once the annotation is submitted in the user interface, dokieli proceeds with three operations: 1) annotation is requested to be saved at the user's personal storage, and if it is access controlled, the user will be prompted to authenticate themselves against that server, before the annotation gets to be saved and gets its own URL, 2) if the article or any identifiable statement or segment has its own inbox, dokieli sends a notification to the inbox indicating that an annotation was made and where its retrievable location is, with accompanying metadata like who created it, when, its license etc., 3) the annotation is fetched from its canonical location, and integrated into the article e.g., in marginalia. If the article has a reference to a public annotation service (i.e., a writeable space adhering to <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/">Web Annotation Protocol</a></cite>), the user has the option to send a copy of the annotation there as well. In cases where the user does not want to have the canonical copy on the annotation on their server, or if a user does not have write access to a storage, they can still use this option to engage with the article.

                            <p class="todo">Challenge: work with the limitations in Web standards and browser implementations, deciding scope</p>
                            <p>There are of course also <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/issues/152">social implications</a> of using a dokieli-style architecture: How do we enable and encourage positive behaviour? Some concerns in that regard include for example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How can harassment and abuse be prevented or handled? How would moderation or civil discourse work?</li>
                                <li>How can a resource state that it gives consent to be annotated at fine granularity e.g., liking, bookmarking are permitted, resharing, replying are not? How can the conditions to annotate be indicated e.g., the reply should be notified at inbox A, Ccing inbox B? How can another resource's annotation policy/rules be respected e.g., some resource opts-out of annotations, so dokieli should not be in-reply-to?</li>
                                <li>How can anonymity, pseudonymity, individual, and global identity be taken into account?
                                  <span class="todo">CL: You mean the expertise or reputation of the author of an annotation?  Is this within the scope of dokieli?  I'd argue it's up to the application consuming the article whether or not it wants to search the Web of Data for the author's identity and draw conclusions from the data thus found.</span>How can domain expertise or reputation be factored in?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>However, it is also a question to what extent can or should these be solved within dokieli?</p>
                            <p class="todo">We should keep the aim on interoperability, not create yet another silo</p>
                            <p class="todo">End on meaning for social machines: we <em>are</em> the machine, we should have our own spaces; they should get connected</p>

                            <p class="todo">Where/how should we mention author/annotator (data) verification/signatures? We only need to mention them as being important challenges, and that and some possible approach (don't necessarily have to name them individually) can be adopted by dokieli b/c of it being playing in the same tech/standards stack with the options out there e.g., JSON-LD Signatures</p>
